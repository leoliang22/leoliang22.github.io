summary: "I wired up a button controller using a Rasberry Pi and some open source firmware for the Rasberry Pi Pico"
---

Button controllers have become a popular way to enjoy playing games such as fighting games. Companies like HitBox have inspired many other companies to start create similar controllers. Now the market is filled with several of these button controllers. Even companies like Razer have created a button controller. I play some games where using an all button controller would make sense, so I decided to try make one for myself.

In order to create an all button controller, I used a Rasberry Pi Pico, keyboard switches and keycaps, a cardboard box, and wires and solder to connect the switches to the Pico. I cut holes into the cardboard box the size of the keyboard switch to the desired layout. I then put the switches into the cutout and then started soldering the wires to the Pico. Once I finished soldering, I flashed the Pico with some open source firmware to have it function as a controller whe plugged in. Maybe in the future I will try to write my own firmware for the Pico. This project was my first experience soldering, and I learned to solder through this experience.
