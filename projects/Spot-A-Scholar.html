 <p>Spot-A-Scholar was a web application developed for ICS 314. It was a web application intended for the use of creating study sessions. It uses Meteor and Uniforms to allow for users to send information into a collection. There are three main collections for our web application. We have a collection of users, one for the meetings, and another one for the participants of the meeting. This project was done as a team of 5.</p>

<p>The things that I was responsible for in this project was creating the collection of users. That means I was responsible for the create user profile page, the show user profile page, and the edit user profile page. I also created the create meeting page, and a basic meeting schema for the meeting collection, that was later changed. I was also mainly responsible for deploying the web application to digital ocean.</p>

<p>This project taught me to work in a team, as we delegated tasks to different people. It allowed me to use Meteor and Uniforms to create a web application, and use collections from MongoDB to store data. It allowed me to use some of the things I learned, and apply it to a practical application. It helped me use GitHub to collaborate with others on a project in a more efficient way, as we were all working on the same files.</p>

<p>This is an image of the web application. This shows the list of meetings that are planned on the Spot-A-Scholar web application.</p>
