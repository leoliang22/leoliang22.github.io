Animal Farm was a project for EE 205 that went through several iterations. It was used to hold data regarding different animals, starting off with a cat. We would then have to keep track of the different atributes of the cat, like the name and color of the cat. The project first started out in C, with us storing the data in an array. We then upgraded that database, and started using structs to hold the data. We then created a singly linked list and linked the cats together as objects. After that, we converted it to C++, and then created classes for the cats, as well as two more generic classes, mammals and animals. 

This project taught me how to create a database structure that can store information about the object that you are interested in. It gave me experience in using a linked list to store data. I also learned to iterate over code, as it was a long project that went through several changes. More importantly in my mind, it gave me more experience in using classes, and using inheritance of methods for classes.
