<p>To become a software engineer, you must figure out what makes a software engineer. <em>According to Michigan Tech, “Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications.”</em> From there, we can break down the jobs of a software engineer into 4 parts, design, development, testing, and then maintenance. For me to become a proper software engineer then, I must be at least somewhat proficient in each of these fields.</p>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

<p>In terms of design, I feel that I am not currently qualified or proficient in designing something like a webpage or an application’s graphical user interface. I feel that this is something that I can learn and improve on in the future. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all things that could help me to design a better software application and are things that I am looking forward to learning.</p>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<p>In terms of the skills that make a software engineer, I feel that this is the area that I am the strongest in. I have developed functions and code to solve a lot of practice problems, so I feel somewhat confident in my strengths here. Now, these practice problems were in languages like C, so there will be a small learning curve as I transition to JavaScript.
Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.</p>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

<p>For testing, I have done some really rudimentary testing in my programs. I put in print statements that will tell me if the code has reached a certain part of the code, and print statements to see certain values of variables at different times in the code’s execution. Hopefully I will learn to have a more structured way to test code and have something that is applicable to many different types of applications.</p>

<h2 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h2>

<p>So far, I have not had to do maintenance of any software applications. Most of my applications are not constantly having new features added and are mostly applications that I am using for myself. Maybe if I end up deploying something online, I will need to work and learn maintenance techniques. I think for the future, this will be something that I will need to work on.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-about-me">So What About Me?</h2>

<p>I think that there is a long way for me to go to become a proper software engineer. There are things that I feel that I am okay with, but I think that there is a lot for me to learn. I think that what I will be learning in terms of design, testing, and maintenance will be quite helpful for me to become a better software engineer.</p>
