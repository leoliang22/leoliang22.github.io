  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Earlier, I wrote an <a href="https://leoliang22.github.io/essays/Engineering-a-Software-Engineer.html">essay about what makes a software engineer</a>, and where I was in that process. In that essay, software engineering was broken down into 4 parts, design, development, testing, and maintenance. Now, I will be discussing some of the things I learned in this area.</p>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>In terms of design, I have learned how to create basic webpages using HTML and CSS. Things like Bootstrap 5 and React allow for ease of creation in webpages and functionality.</p>

<p><em>A Wikipedia mockup I created using Bootstrap 5</em></p>

<p>Besides the typical webpage design, I also learned about design patterns. Design patterns are patterns that occur in the design process. They are not necessarily a specific design, but rather a general idea of how to design something.  Some examples of design patterns are the factory design pattern, where you have an initial class that can be changed to develop other classes, such as a shape factory generating individual shapes, or the observer design pattern, where there is an object that maintains the data, and an observer that observes the data from the maintainer.</p>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<p>In my previous essay I talked about my skills in coding as deployment, and now I know I was misunderstanding the situation. I thought that deployment meant how well you could code to deploy an application, but now I know it means deploying the application to the client, or the world. I recently learned how to deploy a web application using digital ocean, which allows for other people to access the web application.</p>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

<p>I have learned to create rudimentary testing using testcafe. From my understanding, testcafe is used to test the functionality of a web application. It can test the pages of the web application, and test sending information from the user to the collection database of the server. The testing is more testing the functionality of the web application, rather than testing the code itself.</p>

<h2 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h2>

<p>I think in terms of maintenance, I have not learned much. The extent of maintenance I have done is to update the web application on digital ocean to the latest version of the web application. There was not really major traffic to the web application I deployed, but it occasionally did go down, so I guess redeploying could count as maintenance.</p>

<h2 id="where-am-i-now">Where am I now?</h2>

<p>From my first essay where I described what made a software engineer, I feel that I have grown a lot in the design and development areas. I learned to create basic web applications and deploy them to digital ocean. I learned about design patterns and how they can be used to create better applications. In terms of testing, I learned how to use testcafe to test web applications. In terms of maintenance, not much has changed. There is still a lot for me to learn.</p>
