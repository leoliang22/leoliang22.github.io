Smart questions are a process in which one can learn many things and improve themselves. By learning how to ask smart questions, you learn about the process of troubleshooting a problem. A smart question is one that is descriptive, and describes some of the things you went through to try and solve the problem. By asking a smart question, you understand what some of the variables are that may affect the problem. Things like the version you are running or possibly what applications you may have in the background may be things that affect the results, although you want to refrain from adding on too much unnecessary information.

There are of course, bad questions, as well. Questions that are very vague, or just simply asking for a solution that has been answered already. You could be asking about a topic in the wrong place. This would be like asking a chemist a question about calculus. You’re probably not going to get the response you are looking for. It seems likely that you are going to get worse results if you ask a question poorly. Let’s take a deeper look at some questions and analyze them deeper. 


## [Question 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77056075/i-need-help-writting-a-program-for-our-nonprofit)

This is a question from a user to Stack Overflow about asking for help to create a program. The person themselves says that they have no idea what they are doing. They wanted to create a program to hold information of the age and name of an animal and to schedule the vaccines and wormers for the animal. This is an example of a bad question. Instead of tackling a certain problem and asking for guidance, they are simply asking for someone to basically create a program for them. Most people are willing to guide someone in the right direction, but are not willing to just create something for free for someone. Another reason that this was a bad question, but may not be visible now as it was edited, was the fact that there were spelling errors scattered throughout the post. That just makes it seem like they were in a rush or did not put a lot of effort into the question. This question was considered a bad question by Stack Overflow, and they closed the question and are not accepting new responses.

## [Question 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6841333/why-is-subtracting-these-two-epoch-milli-times-in-year-1927-giving-a-strange-r)

This is a question from a user to Stack Overflow asking about an issue running code and getting a different result than they expected. They included a snippet of the code and the output, and a different snippet where they get a result which is different from what they expected. They also included the version of Java they were using. They were subtracting two epoch times one second after each other, and were getting a result that was not one second apart. This is a good question as it provides a lot of detail about the problem and how to replicate it, as well as the version of Java that they were using. This question ended up getting a ton of responses explaining the reason for the discrepancy in results that they were experiencing. 

## Conclusions

Asking smart questions is a skill that can be developed. By asking smart questions, you become smarter on the topic. You do the preliminary research before asking the question, and you learn about some probable causes. You troubleshoot those problems, and if the issue still occurs, you can learn more from what the community will respond to you with. Overall, asking smart questions and the process of asking smart questions are tools that will help you improve your skills in any field.
