As a programmer who previously used C, and C++, and to a much lesser extent, python to code, my introduction to JavaScript has been mostly positive. So far, I have been learning JavaScript for about 2 weeks. So what are my introductory thoughts on JavaScript?

## The Good

Some of my favorite things about JavaScript is the freedom and features that it provides you. JavaScript has a bunch of built in methods that are really helpful as a programmer. Some of my favorite methods are the push, pop, shift, and unshift methods. These methods allow you to easily modify data in an array, and you can set up basic data structures like queues or stacks using those methods. In C, the programming language that I used the most, you had to manually create a data structure like a queue and create your own push and pop methods.
	
Another thing that is interesting about JavaScript is the fact that the variables that you are creating for functions or returning are not fixed. The type of those variables are not fixed to anything, meaning that you could have a function that could return both an integer and a string, which is something that you could not do in C and C++. This is a powerful thing, and allows for flexibility in the way that you create and plan out your functions.


## The Bad

The fact that variable types are not fixed in JavaScript is both a good and a bad thing. It is good in the way that it allows for a lot of flexibility in the types of variables that you are allowed to take in as inputs, and return, but it is also bad in that way. You could be passing in a character when you meant to be passing an integer and you would be none the wiser. In that way, I would say that JavaScript is more free, which could allow for more errors to be made.

## The Ugly

One thing happened to me when I was practicing JavaScript and solving a practice problem and it rubbed me the wrong way. When I was iterating over a string and using the length method to set a stopping point at the end of a string, I ended up spelling the method wrong, something like lenght. The function that I created ran without issues, and there were no signs of issues until I saw the result. Now this could be due to the IDE I was using (I was using JSFiddle at this point), and maybe there was a good reason for it, maybe there is a method called lenght that has a specific usage, but from what I know and what I have done previously, I would hope it would have shown me an error or alerted me that what I was trying to do did not exist.

## Conclusions

Overall, I have a positive first impression of JavaScript, I think that it is a very powerful language. The language has a lot of flexibility, and because of that provides options that other languages may not have. I do have minor grievances, perhaps due to the IDE that I used, and perhaps the flexibility may cause some issues in the beginning when I am not used to it, but overall, I have high hopes on what I can learn in JavaScript.
